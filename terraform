## Terraform Taint

Use case: Suppose you have an AWS EC2 instance managed by Terraform, and you suspect that the instance is in an unhealthy state and want to force its recreation.

main.tf
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0" # Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```
```
* terraform init
* terraform apply
* terraform state list
* terraform taint 
terraform taint aws_instance.example

# terraform taint aws_instance.example
Resource instance aws_instance.example has been marked as tainted.
