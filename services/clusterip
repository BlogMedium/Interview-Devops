## ClusterIP 
is the default service type in Kubernetes which is accessible only within the Kubernetes cluster. 
It exposes application pods to internal network traffic which enables communication with other objects running within the cluster. 

for example : if we have different microservices in eks cluster. frontend micorservice can talk to backend microservice.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      -  image: nginx
         name: nginc-ctr
---         
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment-clusterip-svc
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - name: nginx-port
      protocol: TCP
      port: 32767
      targetPort: 80
```

## NodePort Service

In Kubernetes, a NodePort service exposes an application to outside world.from the range 30000-32767 on every node in the cluster and 
forwards traffic to the corresponding ClusterIP service running on that node.
```
$ kubectl create deploy webapp --image=nginx --replicas=2

$ kubectl get deployment

$ kubectl get pods 

kubectl expose deploy webapp --name=web-service --type=NodePort --port=80

example curl -k http://workernodeip:32218
  
```

## The LoadBalancer service type in Kubernetes exposes a service outside the cluster and automatically provisions a load balancer in a cloud environment like AWSetc
It creates a unique IP address that distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of our application running in the cluster.


```
kubectl expose deploy <deployment-name> --name=<service-name> --type=LoadBalancer --port=<port-name>
```
